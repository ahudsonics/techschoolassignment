<h1>Anthony Hudson</h1>

<p>
What I want to get out of IC Stars is the training needed to succeed in <strong>technology, business and leadership.</strong> Thus I would have the tools needed for a sucessful career and beyond.
<br> First, I want to learn all that I can with <b>tech.</b> There is so much from coding to the basic of computing itself that I want to advance on.
<br> Second, I want to learn <i>business.</i> From being a contractor to full on entreprenuership, I want to sucessed in the world of business and be more financial stable.
<br> Lastly, I want to learn about <sub>leadership.</sub> Stepping up to the plate and embrace being a leader will make one become successful in both their careers and beyond.
